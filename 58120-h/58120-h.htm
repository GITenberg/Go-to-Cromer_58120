<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>GO TO
CROMER.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if
you went anywhere.&nbsp; Dr. Perry was a week at Cromer once, and
he holds it to be the best of all sea-bathing places.&nbsp; A
fine open sea, he says, and very pure
air.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Emma</i>, by Jane Austen, page 72.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> do the dog-days begin?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Francis Moore, Physician,&rdquo; and other authorities,
ancient and modern, tell us on the 3rd of July.&nbsp; But the
puzzling star, Sirius, in its gradual recession from our world,
has not only changed its complexion from the ruddy hue of youth
to the pallor of age, but owing either to the parsimonious habits
of increasing years, or, perhaps, bodily infirmity, it has often
withheld of late years the full downpour of its (supposed)
heat-raising rays until the end of the month.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span><span
class="smcap">As</span> soon, however, as the historic period of
its influence returns, the crave for change and relief from the
ties and worries of business of every kind, and town life
generally, becomes well-nigh irresistible.</p>
<p>Now, as one who has for many a year resolutely sought, or made
opportunity, to obey the annual prompting of nature to change his
heaven&mdash;a feeling akin to the periodical impulse of winged
bipeds to migrate&mdash;thus, and thus only, perhaps, maintaining
in healthy vigour such power of mind and body as he has been
endowed with, to a time of life when many shrink from the
activities of muscular exertion, if they have not long ago
abandoned pedestrian exploration and cycle tours, which the
writer has not, let me back up the opinion of the faculty, as
represented by Mr. Woodhouse&rsquo;s family doctor, in the
quotation at the head of this paper, and recommend a visit of
fair length to Cromer, combined with such mild expeditions in its
neighbourhood, by sea and land, as may be possible and
convenient.</p>
<p>Far back in the pleasant past, I spent a holiday week at the
Land&rsquo;s End, with a Cornish coast-painter of some fame and
success.&nbsp; While I splashed my block in rough representation
of the yellow sands, the many-hued rocks, bearded with a
patriarchal growth of hoary lichen, the pea-green fore sea and
purple distance, he was <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>composing close by two or three large
pictures of the same scenes, putting in a stranded vessel here,
or making the sea alive there with fishers and their nets and
boats&mdash;the latter almost on the move beneath the leverage of
the long oars, or the force on the bulging sails of the unseen
wind blowing where it listed.</p>
<p>These objects and actors on other but similar scenes, that
both eye and hand had kept copies of, perhaps for years, were now
transferred by the painter to his canvas &ldquo;to improve the
occasion&rdquo; by giving life and interest to a
spot&mdash;beautiful always, though at the time barren of
incident&mdash;which in the process of years most often present
such stirring aspects as he then depicted.</p>
<p>I recalled the admirable pictures of my, alas! deceased
friend, when my eye fell on the photographs ranged on the sides
of the railway carriage that bore me to Cromer last summer.</p>
<p>We may well be thankful the Great Eastern Railway for the
pleasure these cannot fail to give to the weary traveller.</p>
<p>As the ear soon ceases to be affected by the roaring of a
Giessbach, so the eye becomes blind almost to those, perhaps,
necessary evils, the huge placards that cover the walls of
station after station.&nbsp; But the same advertisement reduced
and ingeniously inserted between the pages of <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>the Magazine
that we listlessly turn over, spring on us ever and anon from
their ambushes, and cannot be ignored; and the message they bring
is often as prompt, if not as painful, a thrust into one&rsquo;s
memory and heart as was Ehud&rsquo;s into the obese body of
Eglon, King of Moab.</p>
<p>Such a-going upstairs in a carrying chair as meets the eye
when the finger turns to the index of contents, if not a sad
remembrancer of some sufferer near and dear, is distressingly
suggestive of the ills that one&rsquo;s own flesh may be heir to,
and the numbness of leg resulting from long sitting is apt to be
magnified by apprehension into creeping paralysis.</p>
<p>While the complacency of the matron in her sixth decade,
asserting a claim to the complexion of sweet seventeen, is so
<i>cheeky</i>, and we feel annoyed that our attention should be
called to the matter.</p>
<p>Horace&rsquo;s line, &ldquo;mors et fugacem persequitur
virum,&rdquo; would be a cunningly alarming motto for the many
systems of life assurance that tout in the same quarters for
custom, and often frighten one into carrying grist to their
mills.&nbsp; And if committed deeply to premium-paying already,
and the annual shelling-out time is drawing near, the thought how
to meet the inexorable call and holiday expenses together <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>may cause qualm
enough to make one&rsquo;s next meal dyspeptic.</p>
<p>What a relief it is to get clear from such insalutary
thoughts, and to look up from the vibrating lines of a paper or
book to the well-defined photographs that now adorn the carriages
of the Great Eastern Railway.</p>
<p>Caister Castle, Beeston Ruins, North Repps Cottage,
Somerleyton, Gunton, the wave-lapped beaches of the nerve-bracing
Norfolk coast, and the various Broads, beget an instant desire to
be knickered and jerseyed, and to rough it for a times in and
about these restful solitudes.&nbsp; The pictures are pleasing to
the eye, and helpful to the mind that would, even <i>en
route</i>, be forming some pleasant plans for a free and easy
life in the immediate future, and rid itself of the black care
that used to sit behind the horseman, but in our days boldly
essays to take a seat cheek by jowl with the railway traveller,
and to glare into his eyes.</p>
<p>Not that one looks, perforce, at the opposite side of the
compartment for diversion from the disappointments of life, or
anxious and schemeful thought, as we are whirled by the green and
ochre and umber of the pastures and ploughed lands of the
pleasant and undulating country through which the Great Eastern
Railway runs.&nbsp; The long-winged windmills, which one cannot
see without a smile-begetting recollection of the <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>doughty Don of
Cervantes, or the churchyard ghost in &ldquo;the renowned History
of Goody Two Shoes,&rdquo; the numerous church towers, in Norfolk
so often flint-faced and round; the still well farmed fields and
the cottage gardens uniformly characterised by an exuberance of
vegetables and flowers, furnish a succession of varied objects
that gratify and amuse the observing eye and mind.</p>
<p>But for the sake of Cromer, and therefore in the interests of
the enterprising company aforesaid, I point out a fault&mdash;the
only one I may say&mdash;in these photographs, although in doing
so I feel like a man who knows that he is seen looking a
gift-horse in the mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Landscape,&rdquo; says Ruskin, &ldquo;requires
figure-incident.&rdquo;&nbsp; If living, and the chosen
photographer of the company that has banished
advertisements&mdash;at what must be a serious sacrifice of
income&mdash;from the walls of our temporary prisons, and
embellished them with these sun-struck medals of scenic bits to
be seen and done by our eyes and limbs, my artist friend would
have turned touter with consummate skill.&nbsp; His photographs
would have been full of
&ldquo;figure-incidents,&rdquo;&mdash;compositions like his
lovely paintings.&nbsp; He would have had his tent-studded
foregrounds packed with lithe lasses and be-blazered youth,
tennising on the hard, soft sand; and bewitchingly dressed <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>children
shovelling and grovelling happily therein, with their parents
serenely and approvingly looking on.&nbsp; Many a paterfamilias
would come out in clear detail as he lazily enjoys the
<i>piping</i> tunes of peace without the rebuke from his beaming
better-half, which he would scarcely escape at home at such an
hour.&nbsp; Big-booted fishermen would be picturesquely unloading
their boats, and actini&aelig;-hunters prosecuting their
absorbing search in the pools of the flinty conglomerate that
stretches away to the submerged walls of an older and long-lost
Cromer.</p>
<p>My friend would have waited and waited until he could
instantaneously catch the very similitude of the beach in such a
high-jink and attractive guise as I beheld it on the
&ldquo;glorious 18th of June&rdquo; last year.&nbsp; Whereas,
good undeniably as these sunny shadows in the railway carriages
are, they represent an unpeopled and desolate shore.&nbsp; Here,
the first or last visitor of the season stands by the jetty,
gazing on the sandy and liquid plains before him, as if by very
loneliness tempted by the thought that it would be almost
preferable to join the majority.&nbsp; I can but believe that the
individual is an enemy of the &ldquo;System;&rdquo; that he
intruded on the photographer&rsquo;s field, and posed himself
thus to spite the company.</p>
<p>Dr. Holmes in <i>Elsie Venner</i> is vexed at the same
fellow&rsquo;s obtrusiveness, I imagine, for, <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>speaking of
the Widow Rowen&rsquo;s centre table, with &ldquo;the pretty
English scenes lying carelessly upon it,&rdquo; he qualifies his
encomium with the words, &ldquo;<i>Pretty</i>! <i>except for the
old fellow with the hanging under-lip</i>, <i>who invests
everyone of that interesting series</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another view is of the western beach, with just eleven boats
drawn up high and dry towards the cliffs in stiff and parallel
shipshapedness; but not the shadow of a shade of a living object
is to be seen.&nbsp; Better so, than suffer the saturnine visage
of the obtrusive stranger to be introduced.&nbsp; But how unfair
is this to Cromer!&nbsp; A banquet hall without guests!&nbsp; I
longed for my camera and drop-shutter, that I might take and give
to the world a few illustrations, real if rough, of &ldquo;life
on the ocean wave,&rdquo; and by it, too, in its untrammelled
enjoyment of such pious orgies and prudent pleasures as may daily
be witnessed and shared on the wide-spreading sands of lovely
Cromer during the summer season.</p>
<p>I will lean again on the stalwart support of Mr. Ruskin in his
<i>Modern Painters</i> while defending my view of views.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All true landscape depends primarily on
connection with humanity, or with spiritual powers.&nbsp; Banish
your heroes and nymphs from the classical landscape&mdash;its
laurel shades will move you no more.&nbsp; Show the dark clefts
of the <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>most romantic mountain are uninhabited and untraversed:
it will cease to be romantic.&nbsp; Fields without shepherds, and
without fairies, will have no gaiety in their green, nor will the
noblest masses of ground or colours of clouds arrest or raise
your thoughts if the earth has no life to sustain, and the heaven
none to refresh.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But while engaged in this discussion about shadows and
similitudes we have reached Cromer, and, on arrival, a
visitor&rsquo;s one thought is, of course, where to bestow his
goods.</p>
<p>After a hasty glance at and over the lofty church tower, and
the clustered houses at the hillfoot, and the sail-flying sea;
while taking a deep refreshing draught of the highly
oxygenized&mdash;I was almost going to say
effervescent&mdash;air, let him drive to the Hotel de Paris, or
Belle Vue, or the Red Lion, or undertake the more protracted and
tiring task of finding lodgings to his mind.</p>
<p>The question of a local habitation having been settled, let
him stroll down the zig-zag path&mdash;a humble reminder of
wanderings in remoter regions, and the wondrous railway-route up
the pass of St. Gotthard&mdash;to the jetty, or the sands to the
right or left, and take his bearings.</p>
<p>Or let him then, or the next morning, for the sake of a more
extensive view, or to look up any impedimenta left in charge of
the railway officials, walk leisurely to the station.&nbsp; This
is but a short <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>distance above the town on a plateau, girt about with a
golden girdle of the very bonniest broom when seen early in June,
commanding, moreover, a ravishing prospect.</p>
<p>The refreshment-room of a conservatory type will tempt one to
linger over the lemonade, certain to be demanded by the thirsting
soul as a due reward at the finish of the climb, and which the
pleasant toil renders unusually nectareous, the relish being
chiefly due, without doubt, to the slight sudorific exertion, the
most stimulative and wholesome condiment for food, and, as
experience satisfactorily proves, for drinks too.&nbsp; Horace,
&ldquo;always up to date,&rdquo; advises well &ldquo;pulmentaria
qu&aelig;re sudando.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, or at the lighthouse, or indeed anywhere on the cliffs,
an early bird may count on the enjoyment of a most delectable
matutine worm, in a sight of the sun rising from the ocean-bed
above the blue ring of the eastern verge, and flinging a
bountiful largess of sapphires and diamonds on the sea before
him.</p>
<p>But the many, it is to be feared, &ldquo;would rather gang
supperless to their beds than rise in the morning
early,&rdquo;&mdash;at any rate early enough to behold &ldquo;the
hues of primrose and gold, and daffodil and rose, that diffuse
themselves and blend and kindle and glow in the dawn of an
opening heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>All,
however, will have frequent opportunities of feasting on the
scarcely less glorious spectacle of the sun plunging out of sight
in the molten golden depths of the same sea, at its western
confines.&nbsp; Standing out as Cromer does clear towards the
north, there is nothing to interrupt the view of both the eastern
and western horizons; so that the phenomenon may any day be
witnessed, of the rising and setting of the day-ruling luminary
in the same waters, from the same point of observation.</p>
<p>Then again, what better place can be found if a holiday be
needful to rest the over-taxed brain?&nbsp; Here one can work the
lazier lobe thereof, and let the other, exhausted by the
production of successive and heavy crops of thoughts and speeches
and plans, lie completely fallow.&nbsp; But &ldquo;want of
occupation is not rest; a mind quite vacant is a mind
distrest.&rdquo;&nbsp; What an important factor in the
recruitment of health, and the retoning of the nervous system, is
some light occupation for mind and <i>fingers</i> during the
sundry hours of forced confinement, for various causes, <i>pro
tem.</i>, to one&rsquo;s lodgings!&nbsp; What a recuperative
agent, too, is some interesting quest that prevents the wandering
about in the invigorating air from being listless and wearisome,
because aimless, as it too often is!&nbsp; Let the visitor be
induced to engage in <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>the daily and engrossing search for
the best <i>stock</i>, not for the farm, nor the investment of
capital, but for an aquarium, and the true balance of the brain
will begin to be adjusted instanter.&nbsp; Hours may be
healthfully spent in the preliminary work of collecting such
things as a shell or so, with bits of green and purple laver
attached, and embossed with a few acorn-shells, and the rough
tube that a serpula has scrawled over its surface,&mdash;a
<i>multum in parvo</i> indeed is such a find,&mdash;a stone or
two on which the crimson pholamium has got a foot-hold, a couple
of the common red anemones and a periwinkle, whose keen-edged
scythe never needs setting or whetting, and which will be in
constant requisition in a few days after the aquarium has been
set up, and a green growth developed on its sides by the ministry
of light.</p>
<p>If you are not afraid to risk some unpopularity in your
newly-acquired domain by a certain number of evictions, without
the aid of the battering ram, from the shell-cabins on your
estate, a star-fish of moderate dimensions, and a peripatetic
prying hermit-crab, will be interesting objects; and, of course,
a vivacious shrimp will give grace to the grottoed scene:
perhaps, to your temporary alarm and subsequent interest,
shedding its skeleton in the glass shade <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>or
confectioner&rsquo;s bottle, or the borrowed hand-basin, as the
case may be, which holds your captures, and which eye will not
tire of watching, nor hand of aerating and replenishing, when
once it is established as a going concern.</p>
<p>But I do not offer an aquarium as a &ldquo;Hobson&rsquo;s
choice.&rdquo;&nbsp; To say nothing about rides and drives and
fishing, and moth or butterfly-hunting, a botanist may seek and
find in the season the wild tulip, the lily of the valley, the
sea buck-thorn, the sea blite, and other varieties, besides the
commoner and more beautiful flowers that flourish and abound in
the byways and backwoods in the rear of the town.</p>
<p>There I roamed and rested alternately through the blissful
hours of a perfect summer-day (alas! how few such were vouchsafed
to us last year, fewer, a scientific and observing octogenarian
tells me, than in any year since 1816)&mdash;there, I will hope,
many a reader will roam and rest during many such days, either of
this or subsequent and more highly-favoured seasons, when they
shall have no cause to wish the project had been successful for
extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers, and bottling them, to have
a supply at hand to let out and warm the ungenial air.&nbsp;
There I rested in sublime enjoyment, but let it be distinctly
understood, not <i>sub tegmine fagi</i>: the fagus may be very
well in a country where the <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>chief object of daily life is to
endure life by evading the pursuit, and dodging, as if one were a
hunted brigand, the fierce light of a raging sun behind the
trunks, or hiding with breathless haste in the stifling umbrage
of such trees as may be within reach of the ever weary legs of a
languid southerner.&nbsp; But here in merrie England, give one
the <i>tegmen pini</i>, such as I enjoyed at Cromer, when lying
on the soft bosom of one of the graceful heights so attractive to
the sojourner who would restfully view the panorama beneath
him&mdash;(better, a thousand times than &ldquo;Niagara in
London,&rdquo;)&mdash;of ocean and homebound ships, going and
coming in an almost uninterrupted stream of succession on the
deep blue plane of the far horizon, and the fishing boats making
for land over the pasture-like green of the nearer depths, with
the prized freights which need scarcely be named to any who have
visited this sweet spot, or even heard of Cromer.</p>
<p>For the sake, however, of the chance reader who belongs to
neither class, I will announce the produce of the pots with which
the boats are laden, as Cromer crabs!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis pleasant,
sure, to see their name in print, and there is a pleasure in the
utterance of the alliterative compound&mdash;yet let me assure
all whom it may concern that the fame of the crustacean depends
not in the least on &ldquo;apt alliteration&rsquo;s artful
aid,&rdquo; <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>but on its intrinsic worth gastronomically;
&ldquo;experience hath made me sage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this digression I must go veritably backwards, as these
crabs that have led me astray are erroneously said by some to do
in their peregrinations among the mermaids at the bottom of the
deep blue sea, and make my adieu under the trees that rise, as
Ruskin says, &ldquo;not like others against the sky in dots and
knots, but in fringes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sun shines beneficently
in his full strength; and while a slight shade from the direct
rays is undeniably pleasant, a balmy air sweeps from the cool sea
over the really yellow sands, and up the ochery cliffs, and along
the green sward of the uplying fields, drifting before it and
distributing a mixture of the various essences from the gardens
of the deep, and the salubrious resiny exhalations of the pines
belauded above, and the sweet breath of the thick-growing clover
flowers, for the behoof of all, and the delectation of such as
rightly value these superlative delicacies.</p>
<p>O. W. Holmes knew what to seek as a sufferer from&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This
dead recoil<br />
Of weary fibres stretched with toil:<br />
The poise that flutters faint and low<br />
When summer&rsquo;s seething breezes blow:<br />
<i>Curtained beneath a singing pine</i>,<br />
<i>Its murmuring voice shall blend with mine</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>And he
might have added, had he the good luck to be in Cromer, that the
lark would certainly take the soprano part without invitation,
and complete the trio, for this is no</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Gloomy shore,<br />
Which skylark never warbles o&rsquo;er.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the contrary, few suns rise and set on this health-giving
coast without many tuneful and prolonged greetings from this
happiest of happy birds.&nbsp; I know that there is scarcely a
day throughout the year&mdash;and I have been here in the drear
depths of December&mdash;of which it could not be said</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Streaming as from heavenly springs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So spreads a mist of melody,<br />
The Staubbach of our sunny skies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lark&rsquo;s down-sprinkling
minstrelsy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tennyson, in &ldquo;The Lotus-eaters,&rdquo; has some lines
which had all the effect of a lullaby on me when I recalled them
as I lazed on the hill brows above Cromer:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How sweet while warm airs lull us, blowing
lowly,<br />
With half-dropt eyelids still,<br />
Only to hear and see the far-off sparkling brine;<br />
Only to hear were sweet, stretched out beneath the
pine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And his brother, Charles Tennyson Turner, has a sonnet,
amended by S. T. Coleridge, which <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>runs thus on the concordant voices of
sea and tree:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O leave me here to rove,<br />
Mute listener to that sound <a name="citation19"></a><a
href="#footnote19" class="citation">[19]</a> so grand and
lone,&mdash;<br />

That meets the pine-grove on the cliffs above.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hear certain words of O. W. Holmes again, in conclusion: words
set to music and sung daily by the North Sea&rsquo;s pleasant
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you a grief that gnaws at your
heartstrings?&nbsp; Come with it to my shore, as of old the
priest of far-darting Apollo carried his rage and anguish to the
margin of the loud-roaring sea.&nbsp; There, if anywhere, you
will forget your shortlived woe.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Here</span> ends the journey
on a plateau high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Broad-belted with a golden zone of broom;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And many a grassy hill, with lofty plume<br />
Of close-ranked pine-trees, sits in silence by.</p>
<p>About their knees nestles the quaint old town,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And round their naked feet the wavelets play,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now wreathing them with flowers of pearly spray,<br

Now laying on the sands their chaplets down.</p>

the jutting cliffs, the stately tower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The high-reared Pharos and the sea sail-flown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The flaming mantle of the sun is thrown<br />
At his translation, in the evening hour.</p>
<p>Naught breaks the reigning stillness, far or near,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Save, as the glowing scene the eye admires,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A mellow murmur when the deep suspires<br />
Falls on the rapt spectator&rsquo;s hearing ear.</p>
<p>Nor to conception&rsquo;s gaze, nor memory,<br />

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
